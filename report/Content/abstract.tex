Exploration and mapping are fundamental tasks in the field of robotics, with applications ranging from autonomous navigation to search and rescue. This paper proposes a framework capable of achieving a fully autonomous exploration and mapping, by deploying multiple robots equipped with RGB-D cameras.
Our system incorporates real-time sensor fusion techniques to create detailed and up-to-date 3D maps of the environment. Furthermore, we propose a multi-robot coordination algorithm that enhances the efficiency of exploration while promoting the coverage of larger unknown areas. Our work also enhances path planning by integrating A* with artificial potential fields derived from Fast Marching Method,  effectively considering obstacle avoidance and optimality in the exploration process. 
Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-robot system in diverse scenarios. Our approach harnesses the full potential of RGB-D cameras to produce high-quality maps while enhancing exploration efficiency.
