# Multirobot Exploration and Mapping

## Project Overview:
Final project of the course "Design Methods for Unmanned Vehicles" of University of Trento.

The work aims at achieving autonomous exploration and mapping in an unknown environment, by deploying multiple robots. The project has been developed as a ROS (Noetic) package, developed in Python3.

General scheme of the simulation:

</p>


The solution of the SLAM problem and point-cloud re-construnction is handled by RTAB-Map, by [IntRoLab](https://github.com/introlab). This is done for each robot, and the resulting maps are fed into a map marger, which generates a global map of the environment. 

A OpenCV-based frontier detector identifies the regions to be explored in the map.

A task manager assigns the frontiers to the individual robots, following a precise exploration strategy. An improved version of the A* algorithm is used for path planning, and it ensures obstacle avoidance with good clearance.

## Installation Steps:

### _ROS Version_ and _OS_: Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04

Install ROS Noetic:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop
```

Source the ROS environment:

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
- Make sure that _Gazebo_ and _Rviz_ are installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rviz
```


### Create ROS Workspace
Create the **catkin_ws** workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/turtle_ws/src
```

**Clone** the project repository in the "src" folder:
```bash
cd ~/turtle_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/matteomastrogiuseppe/Multirobot-Exploration-and-Mapping
```

**Build** the workspace and packages:
```bash
cd ~/turtle_ws
catkin_make
```

Remember to **source** this workspace by editing the .bashrc file:
```bash
echo "source ~/turtle_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### TurtleBot Environment

For a first development, the `TurtleBot` environment was used.

Follow the ufficial procedure at [Gazebo Simulation](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation), or simply install via Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-turtlebot3 apt-get install ros-noetic-turtlebot3-gazebo 
```

Make sure to add the Turtlebot model to the .bashrc file:

```bash
echo "export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### RTAB-Map and Map Merge:
Run the following bash code to install RTAB-Map:
```bash
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-rtabmap-ros
```

_multirobot_map_merge_ was used to merge the robot individual maps.
```bash
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-multirobot-map-merge
```

### Python 
Install Python 3.8 with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install python3.8
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip3 install numpy opencv-python numba pyfmm
```

## Run the project

To run the simulation:

```bash
roslaunch multi_explore multi_explore.launch
```

Final point-cloud is stored into a `.db` database file. n order to obtain the final Point Cloud run the following module in a bash terminal 

```bash
rtabmap-databaseViewer
```
Import the .db file, and export the final point-cloud as a .ply file.
